metrics in the label
"exams questions will require all the math"
    would nice to now that they exist but no formular (randscore, ...)

you should knwo to use different methods for clustering and regression, nothing specific

how to handle unbalanced data?
    images use deeplearning: calculate the weights of BaseClassifiers
    KNN: giving benefit to the majority/minority of the data

basic approach is under/over something; having a equal number of classefieres
undersampling is removing till you have almost the same number per class
    benefit: it is faster
    random undersampling 
    you could lose some information

oversampling: replicating at random 
    giving the minority more weight
    SMOTE 
        genereting synthetic data
        depends which is the best for the dataset
        "take random minorities and generate samples along the lines"
        detecting decicion line border and adding samples along it

you can also split for one class classifier for each class

hyprid use: Bagging
    each subset is balanced and take random samples
    train on portions of unbalenced data and form an ensamble

changes are not segnificant becaus the possibilities are too big 

focus of exam question?
    dont have to remember just understand
    first evaluation: related: cossvalidation leave one out, metrics, should you use accuracy for imbalenced data
    this is the level of question

    evaluation protocolls, splits of the data, how why , which metric for balanced, does it work if yes why 
    5 questions
    variants of machine learning; semi suppervisot in which szenario do we use it, why is it helpful

    ensemble we have 3 steps in classifier ensemble, which part is optional, why

    data streams, descripe the differences in datastring and data stream 

    last question: more difficult, define the concept of oracle, can it determin the upper level of accuracy

    describing algorithm without code, random subspace, bagging 
    describe decision hard and soft voting

    Print out or just show questions; 3-4 lines per answers
    eather you know or you don't
    first attempt will be easier (smiles)

    he will make a document to ask about all topics in january 

datastreams will be on exam, revision(21.01), autodistribution(maybe not in scope), adversarial? (maybe not in scope), timeseries (not sure in exam),
