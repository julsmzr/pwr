notiontransfer learning

interesting/relevant papers:
frustratingly easy tranferability estimation
a survey on negative transfer

train on scarce target data -> train on full target data shows similar distribution just higher acc. -> can give valuable insight

transrate is a measure that quantifies transferability well
freezing L-3 layers from the feature extractor is usually better than freezing all L layers for transfer learning
